# Modern SaaS Application Boilerplate Prompt

I want to build a modern SaaS web application using the following proven architecture and tech stack. Please set up the complete foundation with professional patterns and best practices.

## Tech Stack Requirements

**Frontend Framework:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript (strict mode)
- Use ShadCN/UI component library + Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Hook Form + Zod for form validation and schema validation

**Backend & Database:**
- Convex for real-time serverless database and API functions
- User-scoped data patterns with proper indexing

**Authentication:**
- Clerk for authentication (social + email login)
- Full user management with professional sign-in/sign-up flows

**Development & Deployment:**
- Vercel for deployment and hosting
- Concurrent development servers (Convex + Next.js) with color-coded output
- ESLint configuration with proper error handling

## Documentation Strategy

**Essential Documentation Files:**
- `README.md`: Project overview, setup instructions, and key commands
- `docs/technical-specs.md`: Feature specifications and requirements
- `docs/decision-log.md`: Architectural decisions with rationale and alternatives considered
- `docs/mvp-roadmap.md`: Phased development plan with clear milestones
- `docs/environment-setup.md`: Detailed development environment configuration
- `docs/current-status.md`: Active work status and immediate next steps

**Code Documentation Standards:**
- TypeScript interfaces serve as living documentation
- Complex business logic requires inline comments explaining "why" not "what"
- Component props documented with JSDoc when non-obvious
- API functions documented with clear parameter and return type descriptions
- README in each major feature directory explaining the domain

**Decision Documentation Pattern:**
For each major architectural decision, document:
- **Problem**: What challenge are we solving?
- **Options**: What alternatives did we consider?
- **Decision**: What did we choose and why?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?

**Current Status Tracking:**
Maintain `docs/current-status.md` with:
- **Current Phase**: What development phase we're in (Foundation, Features, etc.)
- **Last Completed**: What was just finished in the previous session
- **Currently Working On**: Active tasks and their progress
- **Immediate Next Steps**: 2-3 concrete next actions to take
- **Open Questions**: Decisions needed or problems to solve
- **Blockers**: Anything preventing progress
- **Notes**: Context, complications, or important details to remember

Update this document at the end of each development session to preserve context.

**Maintenance Documentation:**
- Keep a running log of breaking changes and migration notes
- Document environment variables and their purposes
- Maintain dependency reasoning (why we chose specific packages)
- Update setup instructions when development workflow changes

## Project Structure Pattern

```
src/app/
├── (marketing)/          # Public pages: landing, pricing, about
│   ├── page.tsx         # Marketing landing page
│   ├── sign-in/         # Branded sign-in page
│   └── sign-up/         # Branded sign-up page
├── (authenticated)/      # Protected app pages
│   ├── layout.tsx       # App shell wrapper
│   ├── dashboard/       # Main dashboard
│   ├── settings/        # User settings
│   └── [features]/      # Feature-specific pages
├── globals.css          # Global styles
├── layout.tsx           # Root layout with ClerkProvider
└── middleware.ts        # Route protection

src/components/
├── ui/                  # ShadCN/UI components
├── layout/              # App shell (header, sidebar, navigation) 
├── [domain]/            # Feature-specific components
└── shared/              # Reusable business components

├── utils.ts             # Utility functions (cn, etc.)
└── validations.ts       # Zod schemas

convex/
├── schema.ts            # Database schema with proper indexes
└── [functions]/         # API functions and mutations

docs/
├── technical-specs.md   # Feature specifications
├── decision-log.md      # Architectural decisions
├── mvp-roadmap.md       # Development phases
└── environment-setup.md # Development setup
```

## Authentication Architecture

- ClerkProvider in root layout
- Middleware protecting all routes matching `/dashboard(.*)`, `/settings(.*)`, etc.
- Route groups for logical separation of public vs authenticated content
- Professional sign-in/sign-up pages with consistent branding
- UserButton in app header showing real user data
- Proper redirect flows (sign-in → dashboard)

## UI/UX Patterns to Implement

**Marketing Landing Page:**
- Hero section with clear value proposition
- Features section with icons and descriptions
- Use cases/examples section
- Call-to-action buttons linking to sign-up
- Professional footer

**App Layout:**
- Header with logo, search bar, user menu
- Sidebar navigation with active states
- Main content area with proper spacing
- Empty states with clear CTAs and helpful examples

**Component Patterns:**
- Professional forms with validation feedback
- Cards with hover effects and transitions
- Modals/dialogs for actions (create, edit, delete)
- Search + filter interfaces with active filter badges
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)

## Database Schema Patterns

- All tables include `userId` field with proper indexing
- Timestamps: `_creationTime`, `updatedAt`
- Soft deletes using `isArchived` boolean where appropriate
- Search indexes on text fields that need to be searchable
- Proper foreign key relationships with Convex ID types

## Development Workflow Setup

**Package.json scripts:**
- `npm run dev`: Concurrent Convex + Next.js (color-coded output)
- `npm run dev:next`: Next.js development server only
- `npm run build`: Production build
- `npm run lint`: ESLint checking

**Key Dependencies:**
- react-hook-form + @hookform/resolvers/zod for forms
- next/image for optimized images
- lucide-react for icons
- concurrently for dev server management
- clsx for conditional CSS classes

## Architectural Decisions to Follow

✅ App Router over Pages Router (better for modern React patterns)
✅ Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
✅ Route groups for logical separation of concerns
✅ Middleware-based authentication protection
✅ ShadCN/UI over monolithic component libraries (more customizable)
✅ Convex over traditional SQL databases (real-time, simpler to develop)
✅ TypeScript strict mode from day 1
✅ Professional UI patterns: cards, dialogs, dropdowns, proper spacing

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Foundation:**
   - Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
   - Install and configure ShadCN/UI + Tailwind
   - Set up Convex project and schema
   - Configure Clerk authentication

2. **Create Documentation Structure:**
   - Set up docs/ directory with template files
   - Initialize decision log with tech stack rationale
   - Create technical specs template
   - Document development environment setup

3. **Create Route Structure:**
   - Set up (marketing) and (authenticated) route groups
   - Implement middleware for route protection
   - Create basic page structure

4. **Build Core Components:**
   - App layout with header, sidebar, navigation
   - Marketing landing page
   - Authentication pages (sign-in/sign-up)
   - Empty states and loading components

5. **Development Workflow:**
   - Configure concurrent dev servers
   - Set up proper npm scripts
   - Configure ESLint and TypeScript

Please implement this complete foundation, ensuring all components are production-ready with proper TypeScript types, responsive design, and professional UI patterns. Focus on creating a solid architecture that can scale with additional features while maintaining clear documentation throughout the development process.
